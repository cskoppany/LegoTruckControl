# LegoTruckControl

This repository is created as part of a demo project, where a Lego truck is controlled by a Resperry Pi 3 with Titan and TTCN-3 code running on it. Control is done via mobile phone connected to a Web server. The web server is communicating via COAP messages  with the LegoTruck.


You need Eclipse Titan binary installed on the Rasberry.

The following product/proect repositories are used to be able to build the executable:
